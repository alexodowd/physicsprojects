# physicsprojects
These are a collection of my second year python projects for my physics degree.

Tips:
- Make sure you install the modules as stated in the preambles of some of the excerises and make sure they are up to date
- For the orbit simulator, for orbitting the Earth I would recommend using a starting altitude of 7x10^6 on one axis and 0 on the other. The corresponding velocity should be 7500 on the opposite axis. E.g if x = 7000000, y = 0 then use Vx = 0, Vy = 7500 (or Vy = -7500, the rocket will just fly clockwise instead).
